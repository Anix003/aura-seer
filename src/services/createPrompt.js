DIAGNOSTIC REQUIREMENTS:  
1. Provide predictive insights on disease progression timeline
2. Generate actionable clinical alerts and recommendations

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Focus on EARLY DETECTION of diseases
- Provide PREDICTIVE insights, not just current state analysis  
- Generate ACTIONABLE clinical alerts
- Consider multi-modal data correlation between imaging and clinical presentation
- Respond ONLY with valid JSON - no additional text or explanations
- Ensure all confidence scores are evidence-based and realistic (0.0-1.0)
